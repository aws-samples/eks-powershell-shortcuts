## Overview

The "[src](./src/)" directory contains a collection of self-documented PowerShell scripts reducing boilerplate and undifferentiated heavy lifting when provisioning some AWS resources. 

## Pre-Requisites

- [AWS Tools for PowerShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-getting-set-up-windows.html)

### Usage

No need to clone this repo to use scripts. Each script header comment section has a PowerShell command that will run the script. Simply copy and pasted it into PowerShell and run.
